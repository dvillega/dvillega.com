Living life to the max in New Orleans. A perpetual student of the computational arts, currently building and studying with [@lucid_hq](https://twitter.com/lucid_hq). Also fascinated by the complexity of interpersonal interaction.

I'm an official greeter of folks at our local [Hack Night](https://nolahacknight.com/)

In prior lives I:
<ul>
<li>studied Physics and Computer Science at University of New Orleans</li>
<li>researched anti-viral peptides for the flu</li>
<li>ran a few retail textbook stores</li>
</ul>

Huge fan of [whisky](http://www.laphroaig.com/), [Manchester United](https://twitter.com/manutd), and [metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BG1Ng2pU-8).

Not a fan of potholes, assholes, or [own goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal).
