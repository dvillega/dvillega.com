Living life to the max in New Orleans. A perpetual student of the computational arts, currently building and studying with [@lucid_hq](https://twitter.com/lucid_hq). Also fascinated by the complexity of interpersonal interaction.

I'm an official greeter of folks at our local [Hack Night](https://nolahacknight.com/)

In prior lives I:
<ul>
<li>studied Physics and Computer Science at University of New Orleans</li>
<li>researched anti-viral peptides for the flu</li>
<li>ran a few retail textbook stores</li>
</ul>

Huge fan of whisky (Islay please), Manchester United, and metal.

Not a fan of potholes, assholes, or own goals.
